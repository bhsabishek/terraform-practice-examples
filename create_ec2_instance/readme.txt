Hi this is abishek,

In this folder i have created and ec2 instance using main.tf and the required parameters for it are 
taken from variables.tf like aws_region, instance_type, ami_id, key_pair, and name for tag and also
i have created one more output.tf and this is used to get the information of ec2 instance public & 
private ip addresses.
